 This is a very simple cash register script, that can be easily modified.

 UPDATE! 12/31/2023
 updated the register script to produce a better receipt; it will
 also ask for the customers name and save the receipt. Will check if
 the Folder for the receipts exists if not will create one.
 Dec 31,2023 1:24pm: Modified the register script a bit more; now you can view
 the receipts and it also adds the tax and the total on the receipt.
 DISCLAIMER/caveat: If you use the same name it will OVERRIDE the previous receipt,
 figure that shit out yourself; on what tactic to overcome that...HINT HINT NUMBERS!!!

 UPDATE! 12/24/2023
 So far everything working for me, this script; I just made for fun.
 Im thinking of doing more things to it.
